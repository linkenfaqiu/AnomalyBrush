# AnomalyBrush

    We have conducted additional experiments of our algorithm on the **RealIAD dataset**. The results demonstrate that our method is also capable of generating realistic and diverse industrial defects on this challenging dataset. Some example results are shown below:

    This repo contains the official PyTorch code for AnomalyBrush.

    The source code and the generated dataset will be released soon....
