# AnomalyBrush: Few-Shot Anomaly Image Generation with Dual-Branch Diffusion Model

📁 Datasets

We evaluate AnomalyBrush on the following datasets:

1. MVTec AD

A widely used industrial anomaly detection benchmark containing 15 object and texture categories. Each category contains high-resolution normal and anomalous images with pixel-wise ground-truth masks. Some example results are shown below:

2. Real-IAD

A real-world industrial anomaly dataset collected from multiple production lines. It includes various fine-grained anomaly types and realistic masks, making it suitable for few-shot generation settings. Some example results are shown below:

🔒 Code Availability

The code and pretrained models will be released upon the acceptance of the paper.

🗂️ Generated Dataset Release

We will open-source the synthetic anomaly–mask image dataset generated by our AnomalyBrush model. To protect any potentially sensitive or identifiable content, the dataset will be made publicly available after the paper is officially accepted.
